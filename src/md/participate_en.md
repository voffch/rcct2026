To participate in the conference you need to register, make and send us the abstract, and pay the participation fee.

#### 1. Registration

You will have to use the <a class="link underline" target="_blank" href="https://scievent.urfu.ru/rcct2026">Scientific event website</a> of the Ural Federal University to register. Unfortunately, the website is only available in Russian. Please use the browser's built-in translation tools and our detailed [instructions](/docs/RCCT2026_register_EN.pdf), and do not hesitate to contact us via [info@rcct2026.ru](mailto:info@rcct2026.ru) in case of any difficulties.

Please pay attention that **only the participant** has to register, while co-authors who do not attend the conference do not have to. If an accompanying person (without a presentation) needs to attend the conference, please write your request to [info@rcct2026.ru](mailto:info@rcct2026.ru) in advance.

#### 2. Abstract submission

The abstracts are written **in English** in strict accordance with the [template](/docs/abstract_RCCT2026_EN.docx). The abstracts are limited to one page only (one such page as in the template).

The abstract file should be renamed “Surname.docx” and sent to us at [info@rcct2026.ru](mailto:info@rcct2026.ru) from the email that was submitted during the registration. The email subject line must contain the following substring: **Abstract_S#**, where **#** is the [section number](#sections) of the particular presentation. For example, if you’d like to participate in the “Thermodynamic properties and processes in solutions and fluids” section, the subject of your email should contain the **Abstract_S#** substring.

If there are two presentations (poster and oral), please send two separate emails.

Please note that to comply with the local laws and regulations, citizens of Russian Federation are required to submit additional documents (the details are on our [Russian webpage](/#participate)).

The submitted abstracts will be moderated after the abstract submission [deadline](#dates). You will then receive, by email, the letter of acceptance and the specific instructions on how to pay the conference fee.

#### 3. Participation fee

The participation fee is:
- **3000 ₽** for accompanying persons;
