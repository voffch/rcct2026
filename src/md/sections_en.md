## Sections

The oral and poster presentations are divided into the following broad topics:

1.	Fundamental issues and new challenges in chemical thermodynamics.
2.	Thermodynamic properties and processes in solids.
3.	Thermodynamic properties and processes in solutions and fluids.
4.	Thermodynamics of heterogeneous systems, surfaces, interphase and membrane processes, and nanoscale systems.
5.	New approaches, methods and goals in thermodynamic modeling. Thermodynamic databases.
6.	Thermodynamic aspects of synthesizing, analyzing and predicting the properties of novel materials.
7.	Round table discussion «Chemical thermodynamics in higher education».
8.	Special session on the development of measurement methods and experimental setups in thermal analysis and calorimetry.
9.	Exhibition of the recent achievements in the field of scientific instrumentation.

For participating in the round table discussions, only oral presentations are accepted. The exhibition will be held as a typical scientific equipment exhibition.

In addition, the "Best presentation" **competition** for the young scientists will be held during the conference.
